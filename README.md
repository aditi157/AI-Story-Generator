# AI-Story-Generator

This project is a web-based AI Story Generator that creates imaginative short stories based on user-provided themes. It uses Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google AI for generating multi-paragraph narratives in real time. The backend is built with **Flask**, while the user interface is created using Streamlit. Users can input a simple theme like “a dragon who learns to bake,” and the app will generate a complete story based on that idea. This project demonstrates the creative capabilities of large language models in an interactive and easy-to-use format.

To run this project, download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it to your preferred location. Open a terminal in the extracted folder and install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then, start the backend server with `python gem_text.py`. In a new terminal tab, launch the frontend using `streamlit run app.py`.
